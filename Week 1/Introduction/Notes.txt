Important Points:

	.) AI is effecting various domains like Retail Shopping Industry, Transport Industry, Travel 	Industry and Health care etc.
	.) AI is actually two separate ideas means one part is Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) and 	the other one is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
	.) The applications of ANI are Self-driving car, Smart speaker, AI in farming etc.
	.) The major application of AGI is that AGI does everything that a human can do. AGI is more 	intelligent then human and do even more things that a human can.
	.) People conclude that there's a lot of progress in AI and ANI does a more progress as 	compared to AGI.
	.) People also conclude that the progress of AGI is leading us to some irrational fears about 	evil clever robots coming over to take over humanity anytime now.
	.) In this week we are going to learn about what is Machine Learning?, What is Data?, What 	makes an AI company, What machine learning can and cannot do, Optional: Intuitive 	explanation of Deep Learning/Neural Networks.
